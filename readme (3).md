## Requirements / Dependencies

For building and running the application you need:

- [JDK 17](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java17)
- [Maven 3](https://maven.apache.org)

## Installing Maven 3.8.7 and Java using OpenJDK 19.0.2:
## Windows:
- Download OpenJDK 19.0.2 from https://jdk.java.net/archive/ using the Windows ZIP archive.
- Extract the ZIP archive to a directory of your choice. For example, you can extract it to "C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-19.0.2".
- Set the JAVA_HOME environment variable to the installation directory of the JDK. To do this, open the Control Panel and go to System and Security -> System -> Advanced system settings -> Environment Variables. Under System Variables, click New and set the following values: 
```
 Variable name: JAVA_HOME
 Variable value: C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-19.0.2
 ```
- Download Maven 3.8.7 from https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi.
- Extract the ZIP archive to a directory of your choice. For example, you can extract it to "C:\Program Files\Maven\apache-maven-3.8.7".
- Set the MAVEN_HOME environment variable to the installation directory of Maven. To do this, go to Environment Variables again and set the following values:
```
Variable name: MAVEN_HOME
Variable value: C:\Program Files\Maven\apache-maven-3.8.7
```
- Add the bin directories of both Java and Maven to the PATH environment variable. To do this, edit the PATH variable under System Variables and add the following values:
```
%JAVA_HOME%\bin;%MAVEN_HOME%\bin;
```
- Open a new command prompt and verify that both Java and Maven are installed correctly by running the following commands:
``` shell
java --version
mvn --version
```


## MacOS:
- Download OpenJDK 19.0.2 from https://jdk.java.net/archive/ using the macOS DMG image.
- Double-click the DMG image to mount it.
- Double-click the PKG file to start the installation process.
- Follow the instructions in the installer to install OpenJDK. By default, it will be installed to /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-19.0.2.jdk/Contents/Home/.
- Set the JAVA_HOME environment variable to the installation directory of the JDK. To do this, open Terminal and run the following command:
``` shell
echo "export JAVA_HOME=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-19.0.2.jdk/Contents/Home/" >> ~/.bash_profile
```
- Download Maven 3.8.7 from https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi.
- Extract the ZIP archive to a directory of your choice. For example, you can extract it to "/usr/local/apache-maven-3.8.7".
- Set the MAVEN_HOME environment variable to the installation directory of Maven. To do this, open Terminal and run the following command:
```shell
echo "export MAVEN_HOME=/usr/local/apache-maven-3.8.7" >> ~/.bash_profile
```
- Add the bin directories of both Java and Maven to the PATH environment variable. To do this, edit the ~/.bash_profile file and add the following values:
```
export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$MAVEN_HOME/bin:$PATH
```
- Save and close the file.
- Refresh the Terminal session by running the following command:
```
source ~/.bash_profile
```
- Verify that both Java and Maven are installed correctly by running the following commands:
```
java --version
mvn -version
```
